# Call_Center_Chat_Bot_Speech_Recognition

**Programmer:** Zakaria Abdelmoiz DAHI, University of Malaga, Spain. :shipit:

**About:** This repository contains the code I developed for a prototype of a call center of a Spanish company. It is a ``natural language processing module`` that uses the ``Google speech recognition API``.

**How:** :mag:

    - It handles both Spanish and English.
    - The call center provides instructions to the caller to perform. 
    - It gathers all what the client says and processes it to decide whether it fits what it is asked from him or no.
    - It findsd the most adequate service that fits the caller needs.
    - Everything is done via voice and "push-botton" kind of interaction is needed.

**Call Options:** :phone:

    - It allows the client to choose its language.
    - Express verbally what s/he wants from the company.
    - Leave comments, complaints, pay bills, make suggestions.

**Functinalities:** :round_pushpin:	

    - Two main services are implemented: bills and clients.
    - The service bills provide two tasks: paying a bill by transferring the call to a human operator or making a complaint verbally that will be stored textually in a "txt" file.
    - The service of clients provides two tasks: leaving a complaint or a suggestions. Likewise the billng service, the client perform everything verbally and the speech recognition module takes in charge transcribing the voice to text and storing it in a "txt" file.

- The Hiearchy of the folders is :open_file_folder:
    - servicio_cliente
        - Quejas
        - Sugerencias
    - servicio_facturas
        - Quejas
    - Videos
